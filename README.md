Statistical Decision Analysis R Package

This is the first inklings of an R package to perform simple decision analysis based on multiple alternatives and multiple states of nature.
There does not seem to be an R program meeting this need.

This will include:
*A payoff table
*Expected payoffs for each alternative
*Opportunity Losses
*Expected opportunity losses
*Expected value of perfect information

This will be my first R Package, so be patient with me.
